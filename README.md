# Automatic filling for GE's patient form

A very simple HTML/javascript thing that'll take some URL parameters and turn them into a QR code for filling out the patient form on the GE750 MRI scanner. Scan it with a 2D barcode reader.

Basically, this is just a bunch of strings separated by TAB characters.

The plan is to combine this with our participant MRI screening form.

I don't expect this to be useful to anyone out there, but maybe it could? Let me know if you think it's neat.
